            <h2>Sprint 1</h2>
            <p class="date">Published on November 7, 2023</p>
            <p>In our Sprint 1 backlog, we aimed to complete several
                 key tasks. We successfully created the login page
                  and main page, which now provide an engaging and
                   user-friendly interface for our
                    AdventureMate application. However, there are a couple of tasks that remained in progress by the end of Sprint 1. We were not able to store user information in the database, which is an essential component for user data management. Additionally, the implementation of user registration logic is still underway.
            </p>
            <p>Our team demonstrated excellent collaboration and communication throughout Sprint 1. Daily stand-up meetings kept us informed of each other's progress and any roadblocks we encountered. This contributed to a cohesive and productive work environment.
                We adopted a version control system, which significantly improved our code management and facilitated smoother collaboration. The use of Github/Git helped prevent code conflicts and enabled seamless integration of code changes.
                </p>
            <p>Our planning game could use some improvement. Sometimes our tasks took longer than we expected, and that threw off our timeline.
                In the upcoming sprints, we're going to be all about better task estimation. We'll make sure we break things down into smaller, more manageable chunks so we don't get overwhelmed.
                There's some work left to be done in storing user info, setting up registration, and making sure travelers and admins get the right access. We need to put more focus on these key features for the next sprint.
